# Agent Notes

## Writing style

Use straight ASCII double quotes (`"`) in prose and research content. Avoid smart or curly double quotes added by some editors.

Avoid hyphens and em dashes in prose. Prefer spaces, commas, or a rewrite.

When Andee is the requested author or voice, always read `ANDEE.md` and follow it.
